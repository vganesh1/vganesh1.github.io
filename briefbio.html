        Dr. Vijay Ganesh is an associate professor at the University of
        Waterloo's Electrical and Computer Engineering department,
        cross-appointed with the David R. Cheriton School of Computer
        Science, and the <a

        of the <a
          href="https://uwaterloo.ca/artificial-intelligence-institute/">Waterloo



          Artificial Intelligence Institute</a>. Prior to joining
        Waterloo in 2012, he was a research scientist at <a
          href="http://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> (2007-2012)
        and completed his PhD in computer science from <a

          University</a> in 2007.<br>
        <br>
        Vijay's primary area of research is the theory and practice of
        automated reasoning aimed at AI, software engineering, formal
        methods, security, mathematics, and physics. In this context he
        has led the development of many SAT/SMT solvers, most notably, <a

          target="_blank">MathCheck</a>. He has also proved several
        decidability and complexity results in the context of
        first-order theories.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> He has
          won over 25 research awards, best paper awards, distinctions,
          and medals for his research to-date. He recently won an ACM
          ISSTA Impact Paper Award 2019 (Best Paper in 10 Years Award @
          ISSTA conference), an ACM Test of Time Award at CCS 2016 (Best
          Paper in 10 Years Award at CCS), the Early Researcher Award
          (ERA) given by the Ontario Government in 2016, Outstanding
          Paper Award at ACSAC 2016, an IBM Research Faculty Award in
          2015, two Google Research Faculty Awards in 2013 and 2011, a
          Ten-Year Most Influential paper citation at DATE 2008, and 10
          best paper awards/honors of different kinds at conferences
          like CAV, IJCAI, CADE, </span><span style="font-weight:
