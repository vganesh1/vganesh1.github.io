<p> This website presents our work on studying the behavior of VSIDS branching heuristic in SAT solvers through the lens of graph centrality.

Abstract:
<br />
State of the art SAT solvers crucially rely on Conflict-Driven
Clause-Learning (CDCL) and Variable State Independent Decaying Sum
(VSIDS) branching heuristic for their performance.  In particular,
VSIDS is the best branching technique known to this date.  Many
experiments attest to the veracity of this observation.  However,
despite the widespread use of VSIDS, it is still not well-understood.

In this paper, we advance our understanding of VSIDS by showing a
strong relationship between VSIDS and exponentially smoothed
timed or temporal graph centrality (TGC) measures.  More precisely,
VSIDS viewed as a ranking of variables very strongly correlates
with the ranking produced by TGC measures over the timed or
temporal variable incidence graphs (TVIG) of original and learnt
clauses, throughout the run of the CDCL solver over the benchmarks we
considered.  In addition, the variables selected by VSIDS for
branching have high TGC measures. To come to these empirical conclusions,
we performed a total of 31 experiments with 35 million ranking
measurements using the Sat4j SAT solver over a benchmark of 300
Application instances from the SAT Competition 2013.

VSIDS has two main components: an additive bumping of variable
activities, and a multiplicative decay of activities of all variables.
Our results indicate that the additive bumping of a variable
corresponds to increasing the graph centrality measure of the
corresponding vertex in TVIG.  On the other hand, the multiplicative
decay corresponds to exponential smoothing aspect of the TGC measures.
These two components of VSIDS combined together result in the
selection of branching variables with high timed degree centrality
(TDC) and timed eigenvector centrality (TEC) measures in the TVIG of
the original and learnt clauses, as the TVIG evolves through the
solving process.
