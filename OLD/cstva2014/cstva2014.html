      <section class="content">
        <div class="node"><p>In the last decade there has been a revolutionary improvement in the
efficiency and expressive power of constraint solvers (e.g., Boolean SAT, SMT and CSP solvers), with a
consequent impact on all manner of software engineering applications
and research programs. A prime example of this impact is the
rapid development and adoption of solver-based symbolic-execution
techniques in myriad applications such as test generation, equivalence
checking, security, automated exploit construction and fault localization. 
Black-box use of Boolean SAT solvers for proof-of-concept has been followed by the
use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers integrating rich
theories to treat these applications more thoroughly. An increasing amount of 
work is focussing on how best to use, tune, or extend solvers to meet
the needs of particular applications.  A similar theme of deeper
integration of solver and application can be seen with ongoing
research on Constraint Programming (CP) techniques and their use in
software engineering.

</p>
<p>Following a first meeting held with the CP conference in
2006, and subsequent editions held at ICST from 2010 to 2013, the aim of
the  CSTVA workshop is to bring together researchers in SAT/SMT, CP and software engineering applications in
order to raise the awareness of constraint solving in the broader
software engineering research community and encourage development of
new applications and extensible solvers.

</p>
<p>The workshop will focus on a broad range of topics where solvers have
already made an impact, e.g., symbolic-execution based testing, as
well as newer ones where their use is still nascent, e.g., synthesis
and software product lines. The topics
include, but are not limited to, the following:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Constraint-based analysis of programs and models</li>
<li>Constraint-based test input generation</li>
<li>Constraint-based exploration of programs and models</li>
<li>SMT solvers for testing, verification, analysis, and synthesis</li>
<li>SMT solvers and their applications in computer security</li>
<li>Programmable SMT solvers</li>
<li>Combinations of constraint solvers</li>
<li>Constraint programming and software engineering</li>
<li>Solvers and software product lines</li>
<li>Solvers and fault localization</li>
</ul>
