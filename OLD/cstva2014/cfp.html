          <strong>TOPICS</strong>
          </p><p>
          Recent years have seen an increasing usage and consequent impact of
          Boolean SAT, SMT and Constraint Programming (CP or CSP) solvers in
          testing, verification and analysis of software systems. The primary
          reason for this is the dramatic improvement in the efficiency and
          expressive power of solvers. As newer and more powerful solvers are
          built, software engineering researchers dramatically scale existing
          applications such as symbolic-execution methods, or find unexpected
          applications for them, e.g., software product lines or fault
          localization methods.
          </p><p>
          This workshop will bring together researchers in solvers and software
          engineering applications in order to raise the awareness of constraint
          solving in the broader software engineering research community, and
          encourage development of new applications based on tunable,
          extensible, and programmable solvers. The workshop will cover a broad
          range of topics where solvers have already made an impact, e.g.,
          symbolic-execution based testing, verification and analysis, as well
          as newer applications where their use is still nascent, e.g.,
          synthesis, software product lines and fault localization. Submission
          topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li> Constraint-based analysis of programs and models
          <li> Constraint-based test input generation and fault localization
          <li> Solvers and computer security
          <li> SMT solvers for testing, verification, analysis, and synthesis
          <li> Programmable SMT solvers
          <li> Combinations of constraint solvers
          <li> Solvers for software product lines
          </ul><p>
          Following the 5 previous editions of this workshop, held first at the
          CP and then the ICST conferences, this year's CSTVA workshop will
          be held at ICSE with the goal of strengthening the links between the
          solver and software engineering research communities. The workshop
          aims to encourage newer applications of solvers, showcase their rich
          extensible APIs, and act as a forum for feedback from users to solver
          developers.
