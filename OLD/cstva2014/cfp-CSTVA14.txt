propose tool demonstrations or fast abstract, presenting new tools,
new challenges or breaking results in constraint-based software
engineering.

Submitted papers must be in PDF format, formatted according to the ACM
Formatting Guidelines. (Please see

  tables, appendices, references may be included on up to 2 additional
  pages

* Tool demo/fast abstract papers: max 6 pages

All accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.

TOPICS:

Recent years have seen an increasing usage and consequent impact of
Boolean SAT, SMT and Constraint Programming (CP or CSP) solvers in
testing, verification and analysis of software systems. The primary
reason for this is the dramatic improvement in the efficiency and
expressive power of solvers. As newer and more powerful solvers are
built, software engineering researchers dramatically scale existing
applications such as symbolic-execution methods, or find unexpected
applications for them, e.g., software product lines or fault
localization methods.

This workshop will bring together researchers in solvers and software
engineering applications in order to raise the awareness of constraint
solving in the broader software engineering research community, and
encourage development of new applications based on tunable,
extensible, and programmable solvers. The workshop will cover a broad
range of topics where solvers have already made an impact, e.g.,
symbolic-execution based testing, verification and analysis, as well
as newer applications where their use is still nascent, e.g.,
synthesis, software product lines and fault localization. Submission
topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Constraint-based analysis of programs and models
- Constraint-based test input generation and fault localization
- Solvers and computer security
- SMT solvers for testing, verification, analysis, and synthesis
- Programmable SMT solvers
- Combinations of constraint solvers
- Solvers for software product lines

Following the 5 previous editions of this workshop, held first at the
CP and then the ICST conferences, this year’s CSTVA workshop will
be held at ICSE with the goal of strengthening the links between the
solver and software engineering research communities. The workshop
aims to encourage newer applications of solvers, showcase their rich
extensible APIs, and act as a forum for feedback from users to solver
developers.
