<p> This website presents our work on studying the behaviour of SAT
solvers on real-world feature models.

Abstract:
<br />
<br />
Modern Boolean SAT solvers are often employed in performing automatic
analysis of real-world feature models (FM). These solver-based analyses
are surprisingly very effective and scale well even though these
real-world models are very large and these analysis problems are known
to be NP-complete. To better understand why SAT solvers are so
effective, we systematically studied many characteristics of real-world
FMs and tested several distinct hypotheses. We eventually discovered
that a key reason why large real-world FMs are easy-to-analyze is that
a vast majority of the variables in these models are unrestricted,
i.e., the models are satisfiable for both true and false assignments to
such variables under suitable satisfiable partial assignments to its
remaining variables. Once we made this discovery, it immediately
followed that solvers can easily find satisfying assignments for such
models without too many backtracks relative to the model-size,
explaining why solvers scale so well. Further analysis led us to the
conclusion that the presence of unrestricted variables in these
real-world models can be attributed to their high-degree of
variability. Leveraging these insights, we implemented a series of
non-backtracking simplification techniques that are effective in
eliminating most variables from such models. The variables/clauses that
remain, called the "core", tend to be very small that are easily
solved. We also compared our findings with previous research that
characterizes the difficulty of "randomly generated" FMs in terms of
treewidth. Surprisingly, we found that treewidth is, at best, weakly
correlated with the running time of modern SAT solvers for real-world
FMs.
